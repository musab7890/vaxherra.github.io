        Something about me

<font face="Arizonia" size="25">F</font>rom the early years of my childhood I was immersed into the world of technology.
Starting from my father's ZX spectrum, where software was uploaded to a memory from cassette tapes, and one could wait for a special radio broadcast during the night, to "catch a software from the air", and play it on state of the art Commodore Amiga 500, and then later gaming consoles like Pegasus, and finally my first PC, I was utterly intrigued by the unexplained to me at that time complexity of those devices.
</p>

<p>
  A Huge chunk of my childhood roamed around computers; I was also devouring computer magazines, which inspired me to put my first steps in the domain of programming.
  After reading some minor course on PHP I've asked my parents to buy me a fairly expensive handbook "PHP Bible". Then, my next summer I've spent mostly reading, processing, and applying this knowledge to projects like guestbook, log-in authorization system, and blogs post system. It was greatly satisfying to come up with my own solutions and ideas. I then found out that I am capable of designing, and realizing my own ideas. I didn't need step-by-step guidance; I've benefited greatly from the help of others, but only when I've asked for it.
</p>


<p>

  At 14 years of age, I've decided that it is about time to assemble my own computer. After attentive reading of manuals and handbooks, my computer started without a hassle!
  Soon it was me to fix my uncle's or my neighbor's computer. It seemed natural that I'd want to entangle my education around computers, although I doubted that school might help me along the way. I was right. I picked up a technician high school, where I specialized in <i>Information and Communication Technology</i>. I've picked up some essentials skills outside of the standard "education curriculum" that prepared pupils for tests. We've had the comfort of time to learn not only about computers and protocols for transmission but also some physics aspects of electric current, electronics or optics. 
</p>
<p>
  It was at that time, that I've decided to pursue a career in physics, as its way of reasoning, explaining things, and level of understanding required certain depth, commitment, and attention. I didn't want to study human-build systems, but rather understand the nature through complex (human-made) systems. As I've been beginning to understand that the XXI century is inevitably going to be a century without strict boundaries between sciences, I felt certain that the key lies in an interdisciplinary approach. One has to embrace science diversity and start to untangle many problems with a broad range of understanding. After high school I knew, that I want to embark upon this journey in science. My first choice was <i>medical physics</i>. Just looking at a curriculum was exciting: algebra, calculus, electronics, mechanics, theoretical physics, quantum mechanics, human anatomy, pathology, physiology, embryology, chemistry, biology, radiobiology, radiology, radiation and dosimetry, information processing in medicine, programming, diagnostics and therapies, optics and many others. I have to admit, studies were demanding at times, but I found myself in a comfortable position, where some of the advanced topics were already discussed, at technical high school.

  Internships at a hospital were the place in which I've not only gained some practical insights on how to work with equipment, applying various safety measures, but also working with patients. It gave me a solid conviction that medicine and technology are inseparable. Abstract thinking was no longer in the domain of "impracticality" in day-to-day life.
   It was here that the quantum Zeeman effect was harnessed to diagnose a human body.
</p>

<p>
  Next summer I've applied for an internship program sponsored by the European Union. I have been essentially given financial means, by which I must've organized everything.
  I was advised to go to several places in Europe; but the Switzerland was the place where I've wanted to go. Laboratory of Physics of Living Matter in Lausanne was the place where I've spent altogether four months. It was a scientific journey, on which I had my first scientific paper published. I found myself in a country where English is not a primary, second, or even third language. Lausanne is a French-speaking canton, thankfully I've been keen on learning French since high school times. I was able to arrange various duties and formal situations in this beautiful language. I've even attended a class on how to print an electric circuit board in French.

  My bachelor thesis was an engaging experiment. I've decided that I want something "fresh" and extraordinary as my first thesis project. One of the doctors proposed an intriguing topic: a study of the human movement by generating time-series and using fractals, chaos theory, multidimensional scaling and other strange sounding terms. I didn't know much back then about chaos, and that it could be measured and described. It was satisfying to find myself in a situation, where students at a training facility with a phantom (simulating for example a heart attack or pulmonary embolism) roam chaotically around a room, where I am recording them with a camera. I was capturing them for later analysis, looking at each scenario that was about to develop.

  It has become to me even more clear that I want to work with data, rather than work clinically. I also didn't want just to pursue a degree, I am a bit put off by the need to produce regularly some paper regardless of its usefulness and quality. I wanted (and still do want) to work on something meaningful, practical and useful. I've decided to look around, and I've found! Fulbright Poland had started recruitment process on year-lasting internships in the USA. I had applied, got accepted for an interview, and then I've accepted the program internships. For two years I've been working in a fascinating scientific field of genomic science. My project concerned a study of microbial communities that reside in the human gut of patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. I participated in *'web-lab'* work, like DNA extractions, library preparations, blood processing (plasma and serum separations), but after sequencing samples through the means of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) my main task was to focus on bioinformatics and data-analysis of these complex datasets.
  
It turned out that NGS technologies generate huge amounts of data (although not like those found in CERN experiments), that need to be properly tendered, filtered, sequences have to be assembled, certain similarities methods (and hence probabilistic theorems) applied; there are database searches, differential analyses, machine learning algorithms - in short: a new, emerging, interdisciplinary science combining biological aspects of the human health, data-analysis and algorithmic techniques - Bioinformatics. Bioinformatics with deep learning are the fields that are currently occupying my mind, and I hope it will be doing so in the future. It is an ever-growing, expanding branch of fascinating science, with exciting possibilities, and many opportunities to constantly learn something new and distinct while helping the humankind.

              Personally
        </div>
  I am a calm guy, some might describe me as introvert, but I enjoy working with people and participating in the common effort. I enjoy trips to distant, nature-rich places, and prefer them over cities, although I live in one. A weekend spent hiking is a weekend well spent. However, a couple of free hours on a bench in a park during the weekend, a cup of coffee and a book gives me and indescribable pleasure.
